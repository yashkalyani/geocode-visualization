# geocode-visualization
This project is a replication of a Google Places API that is used to visualize locations on Google Maps using the where.data file that contains a list of locations which can be used. The basic concept of this program is to visualize real life locations on a Google Map through a python code. The code retrieves an html file which is then split() into the required parameters and the geodump.py file basically puts all this into a javascript file which can be opened in a browser. This project uses databases in order to tabulate all the locations that have been put into the where.data file by the user.
